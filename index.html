    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an avid golfer and tech enthusiast. I have experience in basic-level programming courses and projects. <br>I also have a passion for finance, I started with a personal investment account via TD Ameritrade. <br>Through this account, and painstaking amounts of trial and error, I have learned about investing and more about the economy. <br>I am curious to learn more about finance and more about the world of investing, such as how hedge funds and investment banking work. <br>Additionally, I am curious to get knowledge of what jobs and careers exist in the realm of finance as well as ways one can diversify and grow in the finance world.
